                <p><span class = "span">Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun</span> is a stealth-oriented real-time tactics video game developed by Mimimi Productions and published by Daedalic Entertainment. The gameplay is similar to that of the Commandos and Desperados series, and was released on December 6, 2016[1][2] and received three <span class = "span">German Developer Awards</span> (best German game, best PC/console game, best game design).</p>
                <p>The game is loosely staged in Japan's Edo period. A new shogun has unified Japan after years of war. However, a mysterious warlord known as Kage-sama has emerged, jeopardizing the country's stability. The shogun assigns Oshiro Mugen, a samurai in his service, to find out Kage-sama's identity, as well as eliminate him and his allies. During his missions, Mugen meets and recruits four agents specializing in infiltration and assassination: Hayato, a grim ninja from Iga; Yuki, a clever, inquisitive young runaway and thief; Aiko, a kunoichi from Shinano and Mugen's paramour; and Takuma, a sharpshooter and genius gunsmith and alchemist.</p>
